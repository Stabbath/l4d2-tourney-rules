## Section 1: Tournament administration

### 1.1 Staff

The Tournament Director will be: [TBD]

The Assistant Tournament Director(s) will be: [TBD]

### 1.2 Disputes

The Tournament Director is the sole arbiter and court of last resort for
all disputes. Their decisions are final and cannot be appealed.

### 1.3 Sanctions

The Tournament Directors reserve the right to impose any sanction on any
competitor or individual player at their sole discretion as circumstances may
warrant.

### 1.4 Conflicts of interest

Staff may participate in the tournament. Where there may be an
appearance of a conflict of interest, a Tournament Director will yield
to a counterpart if possible.

### 1.5 Official communication

Official communication will take place via the forum on L4Dnation.com.

## Section 2: Tournament Format

The tournament will consist of two sections.

### 2.1 Swiss section

The first section will be a Swiss System tournament of [TBD]
rounds. A match win will score 1 point; a tie scores a half
point; a loss or forfeit scores 0 points.

After the registration deadline, the registered participants will be
seeded according to the judgment of the Tournament Director. The first
round will then be paired by a "top half vs bottom half" method. For
example, if there are 10 participants, then the #1 seed will be paired
against the #6 seed, the #2 seed against the #7 seed, and so on.

In subsequent rounds, participants will be paired at random against
others with the same record of Won : Lost games.

There will be no eliminations from the Swiss section due to poor results or
lost games.

#### 2.1.1 Double Jeopardy

Under no circumstances will two competitors face each other more than
once during the Swiss section.

#### 2.1.2 Byes

In the event that a round must be paired with an uneven number of
participants, a bye will be awarded to the lowest ranked participant in
the lowest score group. A bye scores a full point.

#### 2.1.3 Tiebreakers

Ties will be broken by the following criteria, descending :

1. [TBD]
2. [TBD]
3. [TBD]

#### 2.1.4 No-shows

Any team that forfeits two consecutive matches may be automatically dropped
from the tournament.

#### 2.1.5 References

For information on the Swiss System, you can review the following
links:

- [Wikipedia][3]
- [World Chess Federation][4]
- [Wizards of the Coast][5]

If you have any further questions about the Swiss System, contact a
Tournament Director or the author.

#### 2.1.6 Deadlines

Because Swiss pairings are based on prior round scoring, the next round
cannot be paired until all the results of the previous round have been
reported.

Therefore, there will be a ZERO TOLERANCE policy for matches that
remain unreported past the round deadline.

### 2.2 Playoffs

Once the first section is completed, [TBD] teams will move
on to the playoffs. The playoffs section will be a
single-elimination knockout tournament.

### 2.3 Map pool

- [TBD]

#### 2.3.1 Finales

All finales will be played, including The Parish finale.

## Section 3: Registration process

### 3.1 Registration

Teams may register by [TBD].

### 3.2 Deadline

The deadline for registrations is [TBD]. Late registrations will not be
accepted.

### 3.3 Double registration

A player may be registered for only one team in the tournament. A player
who drops from a roster may not re-join with another team after the
registration deadline.

## Section 4: Servers

Game servers will be selected according to the following criteria:

### 4.1 Hosting

The server must be dedicated and hosted by a reputable hosting company.

### 4.2 Configuration

The server will have an up to date and working installation of the
configuration and plugins. The version to be played will be posted with
the pairings each round.

### 4.3 Web-cast support

Servers will have enough slots for up to two casters, two cameramen, and
an administrator. Support for the `spechud` add-on is highly desirable.

### 4.4 Tickrate

Servers with tickrate greater than or equal to 100 will be preferred, unless
both teams agree to another tickrate.

### 4.5 DOS protection

Servers with [DoS Protection][6] are preferred.

### 4.6 Home servers

If the tournament has been designated as international (a.k.a. "Home/Away"),
the following rules apply:

#### 4.6.1 Home server selection

Each team's home server will be a server that satisfies the above criteria and
provides the best average ping for the members of their team.

#### 4.6.2 Gamesmanship is not tolerated

It is not acceptable to choose a home server on the basis that it would provide
poor latency for the opposing team. Attempts at gamesmanship in server choice
will be dealt with by the staff.

## Section 5: Match schedule

### 5.1 Rounds and scheduling

Pairings and brackets for each round will be posted weekly on Monday.

Players are strongly encouraged to use the free on-line scheduling tool
at [doodle.com][7]: it is free, functional, does not
require registration, and supports time zones.

#### 5.1.1 Scheduling deadline

Matches must be scheduled before the following Wednesday at midnight.

Teams are encouraged to begin negotiating the schedule early; delinquent
scheduling will result in a double forfeit.

#### 5.1.2 Scheduling duties

Any player on the roster may perform scheduling duties.

#### 5.1.3 Reporting results

Results must be submitted, with a screenshot, by the following Sunday at
midnight. Failure to report weekly round results before the deadline
will result in a double forfeit. Under no circumstances whatsoever will
extensions be granted.

To report match results, [TBD]. Include a screenshot of the
final scores. Results will not be accepted via email, Steam instant
messenger, or the Steam Community.

#### 5.1.4 How to schedule a match

A match schedule consists of three elements:

- The date and time, with the time zones, when the match will begin
- The number of games that will be played in the match
- The server(s) on which the games will be played

Each team must agree on all three points, or the match scheduling is
incomplete.

Competitors are strongly urged to post their complete match schedules to avoid
any possibility of miscommunication or dispute about these details at match
time.

### 5.2 Tardiness

Each team has 15 minutes after the scheduled time to have 4 players in
the server and readied up. The standard penalty for failure will be a
forfeit loss of the match.

### 5.3 Casting

The competitors agree that the matches may be casted according to the usual
process.

#### 5.3.1 War Rooms

Access to mumble servers for ‘war rooms’ is appreciated
but not required.

### 5.4 Spectators

Aside from tournament staff and authorized casters, no spectators
whatsoever will be allowed in the server during matches.

#### 5.4.1 Requests for Oversight

Any team may request that an administrator be present at their match. The
staff will honor reasonable requests to the best of their ability, weighing
conflicting obligations, the significance of the match to the tournament
results, and the seriousness of concerns about improper behavior that
may take place.

### 5.5 Ringers

A defining characteristic of a championship team is the
capacity to field a team for a match at the agreed upon
date and time. Therefore, both teams must agree to allow
ringers, or ringers will not be allowed.

#### 5.5.1 Double agents

No registered player may ring for another team unless their team has
withdrawn from the tournament or that player has been removed from the
roster.

##### 5.5.2 Limits on ringers

Each team must field at least three (3) rostered players in each match,
regardless of consent from the opponent.

No ringers whatsoever will be allowed in the playoff phase of the tournament,
regardless of consent from either team.

### 5.6 Demos and screenshots

#### 5.6.1 Demos are mandatory

Each participant is required to record and save demos of their match
play. All demos must be stored until the end of the tournament, and
must be submitted promptly to a Tournament Director on request.

To record a demo, open the console and type `record <demoname>`.  It is
not necessary to re-record after a map change, but it is necessary to
re-record after disconnecting from the server for any reason.

##### 5.6.2 Screenshots are mandatory

Each team is allowed up to one (1) pause per round to request
screenshots.

Each player must take a screenshot whenever asked by anyone in the
server.

##### 5.6.3 Privacy

Players are never required to provide demos or screenshots to anyone
except the staff. Although there is no basis for an expectation of
privacy, they are considered confidential and will be shared only for:

- Asking second opinions of skilled players who are trusted to keep what
  they find in confidence
- To expose wrongdoing to the community if, and only if, it is discovered

##### 5.6.4 Responsibility is with you

It is each player’s individual responsibility to ensure that demos
and screenshots are recorded, uncorrupted, and submitted in a timely
manner.

Failure to submit demos or screenshots on the request of the staff will
result at minimum in a zero score for the associated rounds, and
possible suspension of the player from the tournament.

### 5.7 Exploits

#### 5.7.1 AI pathing exploits

It is illegal to intentionally exploit AI pathing by moving to an area that
causes NPC infected to stop attacking. However, it is permitted to exploit
witch pathing in a way that causes her to climb over obstacles repeatedly.

A typical penalty for intentionally exploiting AI pathing will be a
zero score for the round.

#### 5.7.2 Tank pathing

If an AI tank stops advancing for any reason, the survivors must be
notified in a reasonable time. Intentionally positioning a tank so that
it cannot advance when AI controlled is not allowed.

A typical penalty will be equivalent to full map distance and health bonus at
the time of the infraction.

#### 5.7.3 Spectate command

It is illegal to use the `!spectate` command excessively or in a way that gains
an unfair advantage.

Historically, accepted uses of the spectate command have been:

- if the player is out of bounds or has become stuck in an object and cannot
  move or attack the survivors
- If a player-controlled SI is not being killed by the survivors in a
  reasonable time (e.g. instead of killing a spitter, the survivors are m2ing
  it for >10 seconds)
- If the server crashed at some point during the match and it is necessary to
  spectate in order to ensure a proper tank rotation

If a player spectates in a way that staff judge to be abusive, a typical
penalty will be a zero score for the round.

#### 5.7.4 "Stuck spots"

It is illegal to exploit "stuck spots" by intentionally becoming stuck
in a map entity. If a player-controlled special infected is teleported in this
way, it must be killed via `!spectate`. If a tank is teleported, it must be
slain via SourceMod or a vote-kick.

#### 5.7.5 Death Toll bridge

As survivor, it is illegal to cross the bridge on `c10m1_caves` without
climbing a ladder.

#### 5.7.6 Hard Rain elevator

As survivor, it is illegal to skip the elevator holdout event by jumping on
common infected.

#### 5.7.7 Spawn glitches

As infected, it is illegal to clip through a brush or other obstruction by
spawning while passing through it in "ghost mode".

The minimum penalty will be a match loss by forfeit.

#### 5.7.8 Attacking from out of bounds

As infected, it is illegal to attack the survivors in any way from out of the
normal map bounds.

### 5.8 Glitches

#### 5.8.1 Rescue vehicles

In the event of a finale rescue vehicle glitch (most common on Swamp
Fever, but also possible on Dark Carnival and Hard Rain) the half will
be replayed following a restart round. If necessary the final scores
will be calculated manually.

#### 5.8.2 Un-clearable survivors

In some extremely rare cases, a pinned survivor cannot be cleared after
an infected player gains control of the tank. In that event, either team
may request that the round be replayed. If requested, the tournament
directors may review demos and determine if the result of the replayed
round will be used, or if some other action will be taken according to
the circumstances.

#### 5.9 Stream sniping

After the match begins, players will not watch any web casts, streams, etc.
that show match play, until it is concluded.

## Section 6: Addons and configuration

The following guidelines will assist the competitors in understanding
the intentions of the Tournament Directors. However, the tournament
directors may choose to impose sanctions for any addons or modifications
at their sole and arbitrary discretion (per Section 1.3).

All players are strongly urged to discuss modifications with the
Tournament Directors to ensure they are fully in compliance with the
rules before making any changes. The best way to avoid the severe
penalties associated with bending or breaking these rules is to play
with a stock configuration.

### 6.1 Penalties

The minimum penalty for illegal modifications or addons is a forfeit
loss for the match. There is no maximum penalty, which may include team
expulsion from the tournament, forfeiture of already played matches, and
forfeiture of team eligibility for any prizes.

### 6.2 Permitted modifications

The following modifications are PERMITTED:

#### 6.2.1 Menu

All modifications to the Left 4 Dead 2 user interface that do not alter,
nor interact with the in-game user experience nor provide additional
information about the game state (e.g. ZoneMenu, menu music, menu fonts,
menu shortcuts, console fonts, etc.) are allowed.

#### 6.2.2 HUDs

Modifying or removing HUDs, crosshairs, and pain pointers is allowed.

Modifying or removing the blue tint while spawning special infected in
“ghost mode” is allowed.

#### 6.2.7 Red tint

Modifying or removing the red tint that appears while spawned as special
infected or tank is allowed.

#### 6.2.8 Console variables ("cvars")

Source engine configuration files and scripts that do not exploit
“cheat” cvars and do not circumvent cvars blocked by the competitive
configuration (e.g. `mat_hdr`) are allowed.

#### 6.2.9 Command-line arguments

All command-line arguments that do not exploit nor allow the player to
exploit “cheat” cvars are allowed.

#### 6.2.10 GUI options

Any configuration setting that can be altered using the standard
in-game menu options or legal console variables is allowed.

#### 6.2.11 Unused sounds

Modifying materials and sounds that are related to weapons or items
that are banned in the competitive configuration (which may
include: "Tier 2" weapons, chainsaw, M60, grenades, etc) is allowed.

### 6.3 Forbidden modifications

Aside from the above, no modifications to game files or materials, nor
use of third-party software and applications that affect gameplay will
be allowed, without the public, prior, and written authorization of the
Tournament Director(s). This includes but IS NOT LIMITED to:

#### 6.3.1 Visual elements

Any changes whatsoever to the stock survivor or infected models, map
textures, skyboxes, props, or other materials and files used for
rendering the in-game environment are forbidden.

#### 6.3.2 Audio elements

Any changes whatsoever to game sounds are forbidden.

#### 6.3.3 Third-party hooks

Any third-party applications, programs, or macros that read or modify
memory in a method for affecting gameplay, or that provide information
about the game state to the player, or that simulate mouse movement or mouse
actions while the game is running are forbidden.

### 6.4 Netcode toggling

After the ready-up for the first half of each map, changing the following cvars
is forbidden until both halves of the round are complete:

- `cl_interp`
- `cl_interp_ratio`
- `cl_lagcompensation`

## Section 7: Unsportsmanlike conduct

Each participant is expected to hold themselves to a high standard
of professional and courteous conduct toward others at all
times. Abusive, harassing, disrespectful, or unsportsmanlike conduct
will not be tolerated -- neither during a tournament match nor
in any other venue.

### 7.1 Insufficient effort to win

Any competitor who, in the judgment of a staff member, has
not committed their full effort to winning the match is
guilty of unsportsmanlike conduct.

### 7.2 Excessive pausing

Repeated or lengthy use of the pause function disrupts the normal flow of the
match and frustrates the expectations of the spectators and other players.
Therefore, extensive pausing is unsportsmanlike conduct if it is judged by
staff to be excessive, regardless of the reason.

### 7.3 Sound effects

Players may not use console commands or radial menus to trigger sound
effects that taunt, harass, annoy, or confuse other players. This
includes but IS NOT LIMITED to:

- User-controlled special infected vocalizations of any kind whatsoever
- Survivor death sounds, or other vocalizations associated with player
  state or health (such as incapacitation or being “black and white”)
- Triggered vocalizations or sound effects associated with director
  events (such as the rescue vehicle’s arrival, etc.)

### 7.4 Sprays

Players may not use sprays that imitate or resemble environmental
objects, such as: weapons, other players, infected models, props, or any
other recognizable game element.

Players may not use sprays that are grotesque, violent, obscene, or
depict other disturbing or offensive imagery such as pornography,
racist logos, or “shock” images.

### 7.5 Guilt by association

An entire team may be held responsible for the
unsportsmanlike conduct of any team member.

### 7.6 Respect the server hosts

Tournament competitors will not break server rules at any time when they are
using someone else's server.
