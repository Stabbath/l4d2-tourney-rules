The Assistant Tournament Director(s) will be: \[TBD\]

### 1.2 Disputes<a name="12-disputes"></a>

The Tournament Directors are the sole arbiter and court of last resort for
all disputes. Their decisions are final and cannot be appealed.

### 1.3 Sanctions<a name="13-sanctions"></a>

The Tournament Directors reserve the right to impose any sanction on any
competitor or individual player at their sole discretion as circumstances may
warrant.

### 1.4 Conflicts of interest<a name="14-conflicts-of-interest"></a>

Staff may participate in the tournament. Where there may be an
appearance of a conflict of interest, a Tournament Director will yield
to a counterpart if possible.

### 1.5 Official communication<a name="15-official-communication"></a>

Official communication will take place via \[TBD\].

## Section 2: Tournament Format<a name="section-2-tournament-format"></a>

The tournament will consist of two sections.

### 2.1 Swiss section<a name="21-swiss-section"></a>

The first section will be a Swiss System tournament of \[TBD\] rounds. A match
win will score 1 point; a tie scores a half point; a loss or forfeit scores 0
points.

After the registration deadline, the registered participants will be
seeded according to the judgment of the Tournament Directors. The first
round will then be paired by a "top half vs bottom half" method. For
example, if there are 10 participants, then the #1 seed will be paired
against the #6 seed, the #2 seed against the #7 seed, and so on.

In subsequent rounds, participants will be paired at random against
others with the same record of Won : Lost games.

There will be no eliminations from the Swiss section due to poor results or
lost games.

#### 2.1.1 Double Jeopardy<a name="211-double-jeopardy"></a>

Under no circumstances will two competitors face each other more than
once during the Swiss section.

#### 2.1.2 Byes<a name="212-byes"></a>

In the event that a round must be paired with an uneven number of
participants, a bye will be awarded to the lowest ranked participant in
the lowest score group. A bye scores a full point.

#### 2.1.3 Tiebreakers<a name="213-tiebreakers"></a>

Ties will be broken by the following criteria, descending :

1. \[TBD\]
1. \[TBD\]

links:

- [Wikipedia][3]
- [World Chess Federation][4]
- [Wizards of the Coast][5]

#### 2.1.6 Deadlines<a name="216-deadlines"></a>

Because Swiss pairings are based on prior round scoring, the next round cannot
be paired until all the results of the previous round have been reported.

Therefore, unplayed matches will be recorded as a double forfeit. Under no
circumstances whatsoever will extensions be granted.

#### 2.1.7 Swiss Map Pool<a name="217-swiss-map-pool"></a>

1. \[TBD\]

### 2.2 Playoffs<a name="22-playoffs"></a>

### 3.4 Banned players<a name="34-banned-players"></a>

3.4 Banned players

participate in the tournament with their banned account, nor with any
alternate account. Any match played with a banned player will be overturned to
a forfeit loss and their team may be suspended from the tournament.

You may review the public ban list [here](http://sirpleaseny.site.nfoservers.com/index.php?p=banlist&advSearch=e,0&advType=length).

### 3.5 Roster size<a name="35-roster-size"></a>

Each team must have 4 or more players on the roster, and no more than 6.

### 3.6 Other limits<a name="36-other-limits"></a>

There is no requirement that any participant meet any threshold for the number
of hours they have logged in Left 4 Dead 2.

There is no limit on the number of teams that may register and play in the
first section of the tournament.

## Section 4: Servers<a name="section-4-servers"></a>

Game servers will be selected according to the following criteria:

- The server will be dedicated and hosted by a reputable hosting company.
- The server will have an up to date and working installation of the
  configuration and plugins.
- Servers will have enough slots for up to two casters, two cameramen, and
  an administrator.

apply:

#### 4.1.1 Home server selection<a name="411-home-server-selection"></a>

Each team's home server will be a server that satisfies the above criteria and
provides the best average ping for the members of their team.

#### 4.1.2 Gamesmanship is not tolerated<a name="412-gamesmanship-is-not-tolerated"></a>

It is not acceptable to choose a home server on the basis that it would provide
poor latency for the opposing team. Attempts at gamesmanship in server choice
will be dealt with by the staff.

## Section 5: Match schedule<a name="section-5-match-schedule"></a>

### 5.1 Rounds and scheduling<a name="51-rounds-and-scheduling"></a>

Pairings and brackets for each round will be posted weekly on Monday.

### 5.2 Scheduling deadline<a name="52-scheduling-deadline"></a>

Matches must be scheduled promptly.  Begin negotiating the schedule early;

### 5.4 Reporting results<a name="54-reporting-results"></a>

To report match results, \[TBD\]. Include a screenshot of the final scores.
Results will not be accepted via _any_ other means.

### 5.5 How to schedule a match<a name="55-how-to-schedule-a-match"></a>

A match schedule consists of two elements:

- The date and time, _with the time zones_, when the match will begin.
- The number of games that will be played in the match.

Competitors are strongly urged to post their complete match schedules to avoid
any possibility of miscommunication or dispute about these details at match
time.

### 5.6 Requests for Oversight<a name="56-requests-for-oversight"></a>

Any team may request that a staff member be present at their match. The staff
will honor reasonable requests where they can, weighing conflicting personal
obligations, the significance of the match to the tournament results, and the
seriousness of concerns about improper behavior that may take place.

## Section 6: Match Play<a name="section-6-match-play"></a>

### 6.1 Spectators<a name="61-spectators"></a>

Aside from tournament staff and authorized casters, no spectators will be
allowed in the server during match play.

### 6.2 Tardiness<a name="62-tardiness"></a>

Each team has 15 minutes after the scheduled time to have 4 players in
the server and readied up. The standard penalty for failure will be a
forfeit loss of the match.

### 6.3 Ringers<a name="63-ringers"></a>

A defining characteristic of a championship team is the capacity to field a
team for a match at the agreed upon date and time. Therefore, both teams must
agree to allow ringers, or ringers will not be allowed.

#### 6.3.1 Double agents<a name="631-double-agents"></a>

No registered player may ring for another team unless their team has withdrawn
from the tournament or that player has been removed from the roster.

#### 6.3.2 Limits on ringers<a name="632-limits-on-ringers"></a>

Each team must field at least three (3) rostered players in each match,
regardless of consent from the opponent.

No ringers will be allowed in the playoff phase of the tournament, regardless
of consent from either team.

### 6.4 Demos and screenshots<a name="64-demos-and-screenshots"></a>

To maintain public trust in the legitimacy of the competition, it is required
that each participant record their match play.

#### 6.4.1 Demos are mandatory<a name="641-demos-are-mandatory"></a>

Each participant is required to record and save demos of their match play. All
demos must be stored until the end of the tournament, and must be submitted
promptly to a Tournament Director on request. A live stream is not a substitute
for a demo.

To record a demo, open the console and type `record <demoname>`.  It is not
necessary to re-record after a map change, but it is necessary to re-record
after disconnecting from the server for any reason.

#### 6.4.2 Screenshots are mandatory<a name="642-screenshots-are-mandatory"></a>

Each team is allowed up to one pause per round to request screenshots. Each
player must take a screenshot whenever asked by anyone in the server.

#### 6.4.3 Privacy<a name="643-privacy"></a>

Players are never required to provide demos to anyone except the staff.
Although there is no basis for an expectation of privacy, they will be shared
only for asking second opinions of skilled players who are trusted to keep what
they find in confidence, or to expose wrongdoing to the community if, and only
if, it is discovered.

#### 6.4.4 Responsibility is with you<a name="644-responsibility-is-with-you"></a>

It is each player’s individual responsibility to ensure that demos and
screenshots are recorded, un-corrupted, and submitted in a timely manner.

Failure to submit demos or screenshots on the request of the staff will result,
at minimum, in a zero score for any round for which they were not submitted.

### 6.5 Casting<a name="65-casting"></a>

The participants agree that the matches may be casted according to the usual
process.

## Section 7: Exploits<a name="section-7-exploits"></a>

### 7.1 AI pathing exploits<a name="71-ai-pathing-exploits"></a>

Do not intentionally exploit AI pathing by moving to an area that causes NPC
infected (such as common infected, or the witch) to stop attacking. However, it
is permitted to exploit AI pathing in a way that causes infected to climb over
obstacles repeatedly.

### 7.2 Tank pathing<a name="72-tank-pathing"></a>

If an AI tank stops advancing for any reason, the survivors must be notified in
a reasonable time. Do not intentionally position a tank so that it cannot
advance when under AI control.

### 7.3 Spectate command<a name="73-spectate-command"></a>

Do not use the `!spectate` command excessively or in a way that gains an unfair
advantage.

Historically, accepted uses of the spectate command have been:

- A player is out of bounds or has become stuck in an object and cannot move or
  attack the survivors.
- A player-controlled SI is not being killed by the survivors in a reasonable
  time (e.g. instead of killing a spitter, the survivors are m2ing it
  repeatedly).
- The server has crashed previously and spectating is necessary to ensure a
  proper tank rotation.

### 7.4 "Stuck spots"<a name="74-stuck-spots"></a>

Do not exploit "stuck spots" by intentionally becoming stuck in or between
entities.

### 7.5 Spawn glitches<a name="75-spawn-glitches"></a>

As infected, do not clip through a brush or other obstruction by spawning while
passing through it in "ghost mode".

### 7.6 Attacking from out of bounds<a name="76-attacking-from-out-of-bounds"></a>

As infected, do not attack the survivors in any way from out of the normal map
bounds.

### 7.7 Hard Rain Pipes<a name="77-hard-rain-pipes"></a>

On `c4m2_sugarmill`, do not jump on the pipes near the trailer by climbing on
the ruined brick wall.

### 7.8 Hard Rain elevator<a name="78-hard-rain-elevator"></a>

Do not skip the elevator holdout event on `c4m2_sugarmill` by any means that
allow the player to safely enter the sugar cane field without riding the
elevator or being incapacitated or killed by fall damage.

### 7.9 Death Toll 1 ladder<a name="79-death-toll-1-ladder"></a>

You many not cross the ruined bridge on `c11_m1` without climbing a ladder. If
you find yourself on the far side of the bridge and you did not climb a ladder,
you must go back and climb a ladder before progressing.

### 7.10 Atrium gas cans<a name="710-atrium-gas-cans"></a>

As infected, you may not move gas cans on `c1m4_atrium` by punching or
scratching them.

Intentionally positioning a boomer so that cans are moved when it is popped is
allowed.

## Section 8: Glitches<a name="section-8-glitches"></a>

### 8.1 Rescue vehicles<a name="81-rescue-vehicles"></a>

In the event of a finale rescue vehicle glitch (most common on Swamp Fever, but
also possible on Dark Carnival and Hard Rain) the half will be replayed
following a restart round. If necessary the final scores will be calculated
manually.

## Section 9: Competitive Integrity<a name="section-9-competitive-integrity"></a>

Participants have a duty to conform to the generally accepted standards of fair
play. Deviation from those standards is cheating, and threatens the legitimacy
of the competition as a whole.  Therefore, everyone will be held to a strict
standard of competitive integrity.

### 9.1 Penalties<a name="91-penalties"></a>

The minimum penalty for a breach of competitive integrity is a match loss by
forfeit. There is no maximum penalty, which may include team expulsion from the
tournament, forfeiture of already played matches, and forfeiture of team
eligibility for any prizes.

### 9.2 Stream sniping<a name="92-stream-sniping"></a>

After the match begins, players will not obtain information from any web casts,
streams, etc., that show match play, until the match is concluded.

### 9.3 Permitted modifications<a name="93-permitted-modifications"></a>

The following modifications are PERMITTED:

- All modifications to the Left 4 Dead 2 user interface that do not alter, nor
  interact with the in-game user experience nor provide additional information
  about the game state (e.g. ZoneMenu, menu music, menu fonts, menu shortcuts,
  console fonts, etc.) are allowed.
- Modifying, removing, or adding HUDs, crosshairs (including overlay
  crosshairs), and pain pointers is allowed.

  mode" via `left4dead2\materials\correction\ghost(.pwl)` is allowed.
- Modifying or removing the red tint that appears while spawned as special
  infected or tank via `left4dead2\materials\correction\infected(.pwl)` is
  allowed.

  cheat-flagged cvars and do not circumvent blocks on cvars blocked by the
  competitive configuration (e.g. `mat_hdr`) are allowed.
- All launch options that do not exploit nor allow the player to exploit
  cheat-flagged cvars are allowed.
- Any configuration setting that can be altered using the standard in-game GUI
  menu options is allowed.
- Modifying materials and sounds that are related to weapons or items that are
  banned in the competitive configuration (which may include: "Tier 2" weapons,
  chainsaw, M60, throwables, etc) is allowed.

### 9.4 Forbidden modifications<a name="94-forbidden-modifications"></a>

Aside from the above, no modifications to game files or materials, nor use of
third-party software and applications that affect gameplay will be allowed,
without the public, prior, and written authorization of the Tournament
Director(s). This includes but IS NOT LIMITED to:

- Any changes whatsoever to the stock survivor or infected models, map
  textures, skyboxes, props, or other materials and files used for rendering
  the in-game environment are forbidden.
- Any changes whatsoever to game sounds are forbidden.
- Any third-party applications, programs, or macros that read or modify memory
  to affect gameplay, or to provide information about the game state to the
  player while the game is running, are forbidden.

#### 9.4.1 Netcode toggling<a name="941-netcode-toggling"></a>

After the ready-up for the first half of each map, changing the following cvars
is forbidden until both halves of the round are complete:

- `cl_interp`
- `cl_interp_ratio`
- `cl_lagcompensation`

## Section 10: Unsportsmanlike conduct<a name="section-10-unsportsmanlike-conduct"></a>

Each participant is expected conduct themselves respectfully toward others at
all times. Abusive, harassing, disrespectful, or otherwise unsportsmanlike
conduct will not be tolerated -- neither during a tournament match, nor in any
other context.

### 10.1 Insufficient effort to win<a name="101-insufficient-effort-to-win"></a>

Any competitor who, in the judgment of a staff member, has not committed to
winning the match is guilty of unsportsmanlike conduct.

### 10.2 Excessive pausing<a name="102-excessive-pausing"></a>

Repeated or lengthy use of the pause function disrupts the normal flow of the
match and frustrates the expectations of the spectators and other players.
Therefore, extensive pausing is unsportsmanlike conduct if it is judged by
staff to be excessive, regardless of the reason.

### 10.3 Excessive alltalk<a name="103-excessive-alltalk"></a>

Use of all-talk (`messagemode1` in console, also known as "mm1") will be held
to the strictest standard of sportsmanlike conduct during match play.

### 10.4 Sound effects<a name="104-sound-effects"></a>

The game engine frequently causes player entities to play vocalizations in
certain circumstances automatically and involuntarily. Voluntarily triggered
vocalizations can taunt, harass, annoy, or confuse other players. Therefore,
vocalizations that are triggered by the player in any way (radial menus,
console commands, media buttons on some keyboards, etc.) are strongly
discouraged. This includes but IS NOT LIMITED to:

- Survivor laughter or coughing vocalizations
- Survivor death sounds, or other vocalizations associated with player state or
  health (such as incapacitation or being “black and white”)
- Triggered vocalizations or sound effects associated with director events
  (such as the rescue vehicle’s arrival, etc.)
- Special infected vocalizations

### 10.5 Sprays and steam avatars<a name="105-sprays-and-steam-avatars"></a>

Do not use sprays that imitate or resemble environmental objects, such as:
weapons, NPC or player models, props, or any other recognizable in-game entity.

Do not use sprays or steam avatars that are grotesque, violent, obscene, or
depict other disturbing or offensive imagery such as sexually suggestive or
explicit content, racist logos, or “shock” images.

### 10.6 Respect the server hosts<a name="106-respect-the-server-hosts"></a>

Server hosts invest time and money to provide and maintain servers at no charge
to anyone using them. This competition, and competitive play in general,
depends on their continued generosity. Therefore, do not break server rules at
any time when using someone else's server.

### 10.7 Guilt by association<a name="107-guilt-by-association"></a>

An entire team may be held responsible for the unsportsmanlike conduct of any
team member. Team captains are advised to consider this fact when composing
their rosters.
